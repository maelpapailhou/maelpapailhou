I am a law student based in France with an interest in technology, finance, and politics. In addition to my studies, I am currently learning to develop in Java, with a focus on video game development, managing databases in MySQL, and setting up dedicated server hosting.

I am also a political consultant for a conservative party, where I help with social media communication to promote audience growth.

Outside of my academic and political pursuits, I am a passionate investor, always on the lookout for new opportunities to grow my wealth. I have completed courses on financial analysis and have invested in both stocks and startups.
